</category>

<category><pattern>MARCH OF TIME</pattern>
<template>The March of Time was the first radio newsreel: dramatized news events, elaborately staged with sound effects and music, but put together like a newspaper: Its roots are found in a series of ten-minute newscasts heard on WLW, Cincinnati, in 1928.</template>
</category>

<template>"I wrote a talk story about Javier Pereira, a Colombian Indian, who say he was born in 1789, and his reactions at a press conference at the Hotel Biltmore. The proprietors of ""Believe It Or Not"" brought him up here by plane to see if the specialists in old age at N.Y. Hospital could substantiate his self-proclaimed longevity. After tests, the doctors said it was impossible to estimate accurately the age of a living person. He may not be 167 but he could be 150 or more or less"</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>PRESERVE</pattern>
<template>I wrote about wildlife in the five boroughs. We have concluded from our investigation that the city limits are a densely populated game preserve. If it were possible to take an accurate animal census, we might discover that there are more mink, muskrats, skunks, raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, pheasants, foxes, geese, ducks, deer and possum within the 5 boroughs than there are humans.</template>
