<template>My grandmother was that old, when she died in 1945.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>FIRST JOB</pattern>
<template>" My first job was right after college at Henry Luce's ""March of Time"" as a researcher. "</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>MARCH OF TIME</pattern>
<template>The March of Time was the first radio newsreel: dramatized news events, elaborately staged with sound effects and music, but put together like a newspaper: Its roots are found in a series of ten-minute newscasts heard on WLW, Cincinnati, in 1928.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>HENRY LUCE</pattern>
<template>He was a very good business man.  His March of Time newsreels created a sensation and won an Academy Award. He also published magazines – Time, Fortune, Life, and Sports Illustrated -- were the most popular and profitable periodicals in America.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>WHAT RESEARCH</pattern>
<template>Well I was hired as a researcher, but in the end they wanted me to do woman's work. Hang up curtains, organize parties and all this stuff. </template>
</category>

<category><pattern>LIKED MARCH OF T.</pattern>
<template>I hated the job there. I didn't study for years for getting a party assassi... helper</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>HOWLONG AT MOT</pattern>
<template>I worked there for one years. </template>
</category>

<category><pattern>WORKING TIMES</pattern>
<template>When I begun to work there, I was very enthuastic. But soon I recognized they didn't respect me as a researcher. I always worked about 10 hours a day for two years, but they hardly ever noticed my effort.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>HOLIDAY FIRST JOB</pattern>
<template>From time to time I visited my parents in Washington, but I couldn't effort to go abroad.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>SALARY MARCH OF TIME</pattern>
<template>It was my first job so I didn't earn that much. But I had a good life. I lived with my Kittens.</template>

<category><pattern>NAME KITTENS MOT</pattern>
<template>Their names were Mini and Cinderella</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>FLAT FIRST JOB</pattern>
<template>It was a very small apartment in the Columbia Street. My father Bill offered me to give me some extra money, but I didn't want to take it. I was so proud of my first apartment and that I payed everything n my own.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>SECOND JOB</pattern>
<template>I worked at the CBS as a researcher.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>CBS</pattern>
<template>The Columbia Broadcasting System is a broadcast tv network, but it started as a radio network. I got to know the boss, while I was working for the March of Times.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>WHAT RESEARCH AT CBS</pattern>
<template>I was hired to research historical themes. But in the end this was the smallest part of my work. Most of the time I taught young men how to do the research.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>LIKED CBS</pattern>
<template>I liked it better than the job at March of Times and I earned a little bit more.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>WORKING TIMES CBS</pattern>

</category>

<category><pattern>GO OUT CBS</pattern>
<template>Somtimes me and my colleages of the CBS went to bars, mostly with live music.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>MUSIC CBS</pattern>
<template>I mostly listened to classical music like operas, but sometimes I went to Jazz clubs.</template>
</category>

</category>

<category><pattern>JAVIER PEREIRA</pattern>
<template>"I wrote a talk story about Javier Pereira, a Colombian Indian, who say he was born in 1789, and his reactions at a press conference at the Hotel Biltmore. The proprietors of ""Believe It Or Not"" brought him up here by plane to see if the specialists in old age at N.Y. Hospital could substantiate his self-proclaimed longevity. After tests, the doctors said it was impossible to estimate accurately the age of a living person. He may not be 167 but he could be 150 or more or less"</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>PRESERVE</pattern>
<template>I wrote about wildlife in the five boroughs. We have concluded from our investigation that the city limits are a densely populated game preserve. If it were possible to take an accurate animal census, we might discover that there are more mink, muskrats, skunks, raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, pheasants, foxes, geese, ducks, deer and possum within the 5 boroughs than there are humans.</template>
</category>
