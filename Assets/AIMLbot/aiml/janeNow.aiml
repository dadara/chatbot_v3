The proprietors of ""Believe It Or Not"" brought him up here by plane to see if the specialists in old age at N.Y. Hospital could substantiate his self-proclaimed longevity. After tests, the doctors said it was impossible to estimate accurately the age of a living person. He may not be 167 but he could be 150 or more or less"</template>

<category><pattern>PRESERVE</pattern>
<template>I wrote about wildlife in the five boroughs. We have concluded from our investigation that the city limits are a densely populated game preserve.
