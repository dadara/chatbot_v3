discard changes in working directory:

git checkout -- <filename>
Bsp. für <filename>: 
blbla.txt
Libraray/metadata/* -> all files in this folder and all subfolders

remove files from index and working directory:

git rm <filename>
Bsp. für <filename>: 
blablab.txt

To remove an entire folder from the repo (like Resharper files), do this:

git rm -r --cached folderName

git status | sed -n '/^# *deleted:/s///p' | xargs git rm
This takes the output of git status, doesn't print anything by default (sed -n), but on lines that start # deleted:, it gets rid of the # and the deleted: and prints what is left; xargs gathers up the arguments and provides them to a git rm command. This works for any number of files regardless of similarity (or dissimilarity) in the names.
