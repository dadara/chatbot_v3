<category><pattern>FIRST JOB</pattern>
<template>My first job was right after college at Henry Luce's "March of Time" as a researcher.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>MARCH OF TIME</pattern>
<template>The March of Time was the first radio newsreel: dramatized news events, elaborately staged with sound effects and music, but put together like a newspaper: Its roots are found in a series of ten-minute newscasts heard on WLW, Cincinnati, in 1928.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>HENRY LUCE</pattern>
<template>He was a very good business man.  His March of Time newsreels created a sensation and won an Academy Award. He also published magazines – Time, Fortune, Life, and Sports Illustrated -- were the most popular and profitable periodicals in America.</template>
</category>

<category><pattern>WHAT RESEARCH</pattern>

</category>

<category><pattern>WORKING TIMES</pattern>
